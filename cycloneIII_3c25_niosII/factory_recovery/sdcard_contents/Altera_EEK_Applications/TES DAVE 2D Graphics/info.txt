D/AVE is a Hardware IP Core, optimized for easy integration into FPGAs and ASICs. 
Focus of D/AVE is to provide a high quality vector graphics with subpixel processing and extended antialiasing functionality. 
The D/AVE IP contains an innovative rendering engine as main component which allows flexible system integration.
D/AVE has been designed to allocate low memory bandwidth and to be very small with less than 100 k ASIC equivalent gates.

This demo collection consists of 10 graphical demonstrations.
