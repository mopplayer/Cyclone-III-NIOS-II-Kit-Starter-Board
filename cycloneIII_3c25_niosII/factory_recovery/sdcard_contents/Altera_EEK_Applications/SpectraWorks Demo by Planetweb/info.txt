Planetweb® SpectraWorks™ GUI Features Demo

This demonstration application highlights several of the advanced features available from the SpectraWorks™ user interface platform and tools, such as smooth animation, beautiful text in multiple typefaces, dynamically scalable widgets, gestural touch input and the ability to re-skin any application without scripting or making any changes to source code.  SpectraWorks decouples your graphical design from the underlying application logic, speeding you application development and giving you the freedom to manipulate the graphical look-and-feel of your application without impacting the underlying application code. 

SpectraWorks™ is an embedded system, user interface (GUI and HMI) technology suite, implemented for the Altera Cyclone II and III and NIOS 2. SpectraWorks™ takes advantage of the dynamic nature of an FPGA, scaling with your needs to deliver graphical and animation capabilities all the way from small footprint monochrome displays up through full color 32bit displays.  SpectraWorks™ will ensure that you get the best graphical display out of your new Cyclone development kit. Products utilizing SpectraWorks™ are shipped today by many top OEMs, worldwide in a variety of market segments, including digital television, digital cameras, set-top boxes, security systems, white goods and military applications. Using SpectraWorks™ dramatically streamlines the design and development process speeding time-to-market, and producing more flexible, reliable, strongly branded, and cost-effective applications.
