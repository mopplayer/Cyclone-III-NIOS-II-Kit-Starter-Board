Altia Blue HMI
--------------------------

Altia® DeepScreen® can target GUIs created in Altia® Design to a simple frame buffer on Nios II hardware or to the D/AVE accelerated graphics API offered by TES.
With these options, it is possible to get outstanding graphics performance for next generation GUIs on the lowest cost hardware.

Altia's Advantages:
---------------------
Includes Designers and Artists in the process
High impact user interfaces get your products noticed.
	• High performance C code output 
		Generated graphics code leverages the power of FPGAs and the D/AVE engine.
	•  Portability across multiple targets
		Altia interfaces built for other targets can be rapidly moved to an FPGA for performance testing.
	• Standard and open data formats
		Altia’s use of Photoshop®, bitmaps, XML and C minimizes the risk of using tools.
