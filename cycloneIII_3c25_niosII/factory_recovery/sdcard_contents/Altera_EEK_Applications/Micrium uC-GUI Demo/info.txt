This application incorporates uC/GUI, a reliable and efficient embedded graphics module from Micrium.  Upon loading the application, you can expect to view a brief introduction, followed by a sequence of informational demonstrations that highlight many of uC/GUI's features.  In case you need to pause one of these demonstrations, or immediately proceed to subsequent material, a small, touch-sensitive control window will normally occupy the lower right-hand corner of the display.  Excepting any such interruptions, however, the example application will continuously demonstrate uC/GUI's powerful features.

Despite its prominence in this example application, uC/GUI is only one of numerous high-quality embedded software modules offered by Micrium.  Most of these modules, such as Micrium's popular RTOS, uC/OS-II (which is also encompassed by the example application), are well suited for use in systems that leverage Altera's Nios II processor.  Evaluation versions of many of these products, including Micrium's latest offering, a unique monitoring tool known as uC/Probe, can be found on the Micrium Web site: http://www.Micrium.com
