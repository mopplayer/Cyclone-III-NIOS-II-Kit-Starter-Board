VGA Altera Mandelbrot C2H
-------------------------

This is a VGA mirrored version of the standard Altera Mandelbrot C2H application.

-----------------------------------------
Welcome to the Mandelbrot C2H Application!
-----------------------------------------

The Mandelbrot Set is a set of complex numbers that form a fractal.
What's remarkable about this organically beautiful pattern with seemingly 
unlimited variations is that the set is computed from a simple algorithm 
comprising of additions and multiplications performed many times per pixel, 
each pixel in turn represents a coordinate in the complex plane!

However, what this demo showcases is more than just an intricate mathematical fractal
but a solution for a common everyday problem faced by designers: improving performance
on a system. 

----------------------
How to use the demo
----------------------

1) At start time, the application defaults to hardware implementation of Mandelbrot.
2) Click on 'Software' push button and then touch 'Continue' to see Software version.
3) You can also change the color pallette by pushing on the 'Color Pallette' button.

GHz Processing at Milliwatts power consumption!

Compare the implementation in software vs. hardware to see how hardware
acceleration using the Nios II C to Hardware (C2H) Acceleration Compiler boosts
the frames/sec. So while the Nios II Processor is busy rendering the image, paning, zooming
the image, the hardware accelerator computes the Mandlebrot set.

Consider this: A Nios II processor resides in a portion of the Cyclone III FPGA and runs 
at a mere 100 MHz. This implementation consumes a fraction of the cost and power of a GHz processor!
