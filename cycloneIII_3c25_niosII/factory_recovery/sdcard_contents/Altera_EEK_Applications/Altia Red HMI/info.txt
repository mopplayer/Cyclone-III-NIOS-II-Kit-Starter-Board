About Altia
--------------------------

Altia® DeepScreen® can target GUIs created in Altia® Design to a simple frame buffer on Nios II hardware or to the D/AVE accelerated graphics API offered by TES.  With these options, it is possible to get outstanding graphics performance for next generation GUIs on the lowest cost hardware.

About Altia Red HMI
--------------------------

This design example shows a more advanced touch-screen human-machine interface (HMI) application created with the Altia Design HMI editor and Altia DeepScreen for the TES D/AVE engine.
This sample interface shows a full color, touch-screen HMI created using the Altia Design tool.
It has multiple pages, a few buttons, and animations with transparency. The graphics used in the HMI were created in Photoshop and imported directly into Altia Design. The simple behavior of the Altia HMI graphics is defined completely within the Altia tool (no external logic code).

The performance of this demo is greatly increased by using the D/AVE hardware acceleration 2D graphics engine functions from TES. Contact Altia for further details.

Altia's Advantages:
---------------------
Includes Designers and Artists in the process
High impact user interfaces get your products noticed.
• High performance C code output 
	Generated graphics code leverages the power of FPGAs and the D/AVE engine.
•  Portability across multiple targets
	Altia interfaces built for other targets can be rapidly moved to an FPGA for performance testing.
• Standard and open data formats
	Altia’s use of Photoshop®, bitmaps, XML and C minimizes the risk of using tools.
