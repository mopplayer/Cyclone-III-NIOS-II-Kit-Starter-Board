VGA Altera Spinning Cube
--------------------------

The Spinning Cube application demonstrates the Nios II Embedded Evaluation Kit's LCD panel and touchscreen.

How to Use
----------

1) Use the touch panel to select and load the application
1) The application starts with a stationary cube
2) Using your finger or a stylus gently rotate the cube by dragging across the touchscreen in any direction.
3) After a few seconds, the cube will begin to rotate on its own.

How it works
------------
The rotation effect is achieved by periodically rotating the 8 corner points of the cube in three dimentions,projecting them to two dimentions, then drawing filled triangles between cube corners to represent the three sides
closest to the viewer.

A reasonable rotation speed is achieved by running the 3-D rotation routine only on the corners of the cube,not on the entire cube.
