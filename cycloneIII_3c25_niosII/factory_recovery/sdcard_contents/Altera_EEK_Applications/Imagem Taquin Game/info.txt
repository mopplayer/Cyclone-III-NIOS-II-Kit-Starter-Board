******** How to use the demo ********

 Taquin is a very popular game where we 
take a picture in and puzzle it.
 This Taquin game can also use a video input
as a support.

 You have to select a level and a picture or video
support. If no video is connected, then a blue thumbnail
will be placed. The video in has to be connected before 
starting the demo.

 During level and picture selection stage, you can click
on the left or right items to move them around and make
them appear in the middle. Only middle items are selectable.

Enjoy!
