Welcome to the Mandelbrot C2H Application
-----------------------------------------

The Mandelbrot algorithm consists of a formula that is repeatedly calculated until it converges to a fixed value (4 in this case). The number of repetitions is tracked and used to select a color which is then displayed on the screen. If the calculation does not converge within a pre-determined number of repetitions, the result is said to be contained within the Mandelbrot Set. Results in the Mandelbrot Set are displayed as a solid color (black in this case).

The algorithm uses four multiplications, three additions, and two shift operations per iteration. On average, hundreds of iterations occur before a single point converges. This means that a general purpose processor on average requires thousands of clock cycles before a single point has been calculated.

Instructions
------------

1) At start time, the application defaults to hardware implementation of Mandelbrot
2) To open the main menu press anywhere on the touch screen display
3) To disable the hardware accelerator (software only mode) press the 'Software' button
4) To enable the hardware accelerator press the 'Hardware' button 
5) To change the color palette press the 'Color' button
6) To exit the main menu press the 'Continue' button

GHz Processing at a Fraction of the Power!
------------------------------------------

In this design example you will see the difference between a general purpose processor and a hardware accelerator when each is used to calculate the Mandelbrot algorithm. Both implementations use the same clock frequency. In order for a general purpose processor to be capable of performing the calculations at the same speed as the hardware accelerator, it would need to operate at clock frequencies hundreds of times larger.

For example if the speedup factor is 200x, and the hardware accelerator operates at 100MHz, you would need the general purpose processor to operate at 20000MHz. Such a processor does not exist and is why expensive single instruction multiple data (SIMD) processors are in use today. The drawback of an off-the-shelf SIMD processor is that the power envelope is much higher as a result of the high clock frequency. At a fraction of the cost and power of a SIMD processor, you can use FPGAs to implement hardware accelerators for time critical sections of your own algorithms as this design example illustrates.
